			<title>Iron meteorites hint that our infant solar system was more doughnut than dartboard</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240620194009.htm</link>
			<description>Iron meteorites are remnants of the metallic cores of the earliest asteroids in our solar system. Iron meteorites contain refractory metals, such as iridium and platinum, that formed near the sun but were transported to the outer solar system. New research shows that for this to have happened, the protoplanetary disk of our solar system had to have been doughnut-shaped because the refractory metals could not have crossed the large gaps in a target-shaped disk of concentric rings. The paper suggests that the refractory metals moved outward as the protoplanetary disk rapidly expanded, and were trapped in the outer solar system by Jupiter.</description>

			<title>Jupiter&#039;s great red spot is not the same one Cassini observed in 1600s</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240619143717.htm</link>
			<description>Jupiter&#039;s iconic Great Red Spot has persisted for at least 190 years and is likely a different spot from the one observed by the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1665, a new study reports. The Great Red Spot we see today likely formed because of an instability in the planet&#039;s intense atmospheric winds, producing a long, persistent atmospheric cell, the study also finds.</description>

			<title>Non-native plants and animals expanding ranges 100 times faster than native species</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240619143655.htm</link>
			<description>An international team of scientists has recently found that non-native species are expanding their ranges many orders of magnitude faster than native ones, in large part due to inadvertent human help. Even seemingly sedentary non-native plants are moving at three times the speed of their native counterparts in a race where, because of the rapid pace of climate change and its effect on habitat, speed matters. To survive, plants and animals need to be shifting their ranges by 3.25 kilometers per year just to keep up with the increasing temperatures and associated climactic shifts -- a speed that native species cannot manage without human help.</description>

			<title>Tabulae Paralytica: Mapping the biology of spinal cord injury in unprecedented detail</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240619143554.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have achieved a significant research milestone in the field of spinal cord injuries -- mapping out the cellular and molecular dynamics of paralysis in unprecedented detail with their open-source project &#039;Tabulae Paralytica&#039;. Gr goire Courtine and his team have integrated cutting-edge cell and molecular mapping technologies with artificial intelligence to chart the complex molecular processes that unfold in each cell after spinal cord injuries (SCI). This seminal work not only identifies a specific set of neurons and genes that plays a key role for recovery but also proposes a successful gene therapy derived from its discoveries.</description>

			<title>Discovery of &#039;new rules of the immune system&#039; could improve treatment of inflammatory diseases, say scientists</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240618115717.htm</link>
			<description>A single large population of healer cells, called regulatory T cells, is whizzing around our body -- not multiple specialist populations restricted to specific parts of the body as previously thought. These cells shut down inflammation and repair the collateral damage to cells caused after our immune system has responded to injury or illness. Tests, in mice, of a drug developed by the researchers showed that regulatory T cells can be attracted to specific body parts, boosted in number, and activated to suppress immune response and rebuild tissue. Current anti-inflammatory drugs used for this purpose suppress the body&#039;s whole immune system, making patients more vulnerable to infection. The discovery could lead to more targeted treatments, with fewer side-effects, for issues from lengthy COVID infections to autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis. Clinical trials in humans are now planned.</description>

			<title>Breakthrough may clear major hurdle for quantum computers</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240618115542.htm</link>
			<description>The potential of quantum computers is currently thwarted by a trade-off problem. Quantum systems that can carry out complex operations are less tolerant to errors and noise, while systems that are more protected against noise are harder and slower to compute with. Now a research team has created a unique system that combats the dilemma, thus paving the way for longer computation time and more robust quantum computers.</description>

			<title>Astronomers see a massive black hole awaken in real time</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240618115433.htm</link>
			<description>In late 2019 the previously unremarkable galaxy SDSS1335+0728 suddenly started shining brighter than ever before. To understand why, astronomers have used data from several space and ground-based observatories, including the European Southern Observatory&#039;s Very Large Telescope (ESO&#039;s VLT), to track how the galaxy&#039;s brightness has varied. In a study out today, they conclude that they are witnessing changes never seen before in a galaxy -- likely the result of the sudden awakening of the massive black hole at its core.</description>

			<title>Breakthrough approach enables bidirectional BCI functionality</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240617173427.htm</link>
			<description>Brain-computer interfaces or BCIs hold immense potential for individuals with a wide range of neurological conditions, but the road to implementation is long and nuanced for both the invasive and noninvasive versions of the technology. Scientists have now successfully integrated a novel focused ultrasound stimulation to realize bidirectional BCI that both encodes and decodes brain waves using machine learning in a study with 25 human subjects. This work opens up a new avenue to significantly enhance not only the signal quality, but also, overall nonivasive BCI performance by stimulating targeted neural circuits.</description>

			<title>Infectious H5N1 influenza virus in raw milk rapidly declines with heat treatment</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240614141822.htm</link>
			<description>The amount of infectious H5N1 influenza viruses in raw milk rapidly declined with heat treatment in laboratory research. However, small, detectable amounts of infectious virus remained in raw milk samples with high virus levels when treated at 72 degrees Celsius (161.6 degrees Fahrenheit) for 15 seconds -- one of the standard pasteurization methods used by the dairy industry. The authors of the study stress, however, that their findings reflect experimental conditions in a laboratory setting and are not identical to large-scale industrial pasteurization processes for raw milk.</description>

			<title>Are mixed emotions real? New research says yes</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240613161150.htm</link>
			<description>Neuroscientists found that brains display distinct neural activity when experiencing emotions such as bitter-sweetness. The advance could help solve a longstanding scientific debate: whether &#039;mixed emotions&#039; arise from unique activity in the brain, or if we&#039;re just flip-flopping back and forth between positive and negative feelings.</description>

			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240613140756.htm</link>
			<description>Using isotope geochemistry, scientists have uncovered new information about the Barmaz necropolis in Valais (Switzerland): 14% of the people buried 6,000 years ago at this site were not locals. What&#039;s more, the study suggests that this Middle Neolithic agropastoral society -- one of the oldest known in the western part of Switzerland -- was relatively egalitarian. The isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur contained in the bones reveal that all members of the community, including people from elsewhere, had access to the same food resources.</description>

			<title>Dolphins with elevated mercury levels in Florida and Georgia</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240613140133.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists found elevated mercury levels in dolphins in the U.S. Southeast. The highest levels were found in dolphins in Florida&#039;s St. Joseph and Choctawhatchee Bays. Researchers study dolphins because they are considered a sentinel species for oceans and human health. Like us, they are high up in the food chain, live long lives, and share certain physiological traits. Some of their diet is most vulnerable to mercury pollution and is also eaten by people.</description>
